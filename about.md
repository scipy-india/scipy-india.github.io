# About SciPy India

## What is SciPy India?

SciPy India is a community-driven initiative that aims to promote the practice of scientific computing in India. It is part of the larger SciPy ecosystem, which includes various conferences, workshops, and online resources dedicated to the Python programming language and its applications in science and engineering, emerging from the popular SciPy package for scientific computing in Python. SciPy India focuses on fostering a vibrant community of researchers, scientists, programmers, and learners, with a focus on the Indian context of free and open source software (FOSS) and open science, and its significance in the Indian research and development landscape.

## Mission

Our mission is to foster a collaborative environment where researchers, scientists, software engineers, learners, and enthusiasts alike can come together to share knowledge, collaborate on projects, and advance the field of scientific computing. We aim to provide resources, organise events, and create opportunities for learning and networking within the Indian scientific community, bridging both academia and industry.

Primarily, we focus on:

- Promoting the use of the Python programming language and its scientific libraries in research and development across India
- Encouraging contributions and collaborations among Indian researchers and developers in the world of free and open source software, and building a strong network of professionals and enthusiasts in the field of scientific computing in India
- Organising events, workshops, and conferences, and engaging in outreach activities to facilitate knowledge sharing and skill development in scientific computing
- Advocating for access to open science, open code, open data and open education practices in India.
- and more!

## SciPy India over the years

SciPy India has been active since its inception in 2009, organising the SciPy India conference as a means to support the scientific computing fraternity in India. The conference has served as a platform for researchers, scientists, and developers to present their work, share ideas, and learn from each other, combining education, engineering, and science with computing through the medium of Python. Over the years, SciPy India has grown into a vibrant community with members from diverse backgrounds, including academia, industry, and government institutions.

The first edition of the SciPy India conference was held in 2009 at SPACE Kerala, Trivandrum, India, and has since then become an annual event that has attracted participants from all over the country at various locations and venues, including the Indian School of Business (ISB) in Hyderabad, India, and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay in Mumbai, India. Each conference has featured keynote speakers, technical sessions, and networking opportunities for attendees.

Post 2020, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, SciPy India adapted to the new normal by transitioning to virtual events. This shift allowed the community to continue this mission of promoting scientific computing in India despite the challenges posed by an online format.

SciPy India 2021 was the last edition of the conference held virtually, and since then, the community has been on a hiatus. However, come to 2025, we are thrilled to announce the revival of SciPy India with plans to host the next conference in 2025. We are currently in the planning stages, and we are excited to announce that we plan to resume in-person conferences in the near future, while also exploring hybrid formats to accommodate a wider audience.

However, what are we doing in the meantime, you ask? Read on!

### SciPy India community calls

<!-- link to other blog post about first community call with more details) -->

One of the key initiatives we have undertaken to keep the community engaged is the introduction of regular community calls. These calls serve as a platform for members to connect, share updates, discuss ongoing projects, and explore new ideas in the field of scientific computing. The community calls are open to all members and are held monthly, providing an opportunity for continuous learning and collaboration.

We kicked off our first community call of 2025 on July 26th, 2025, with an engaging session that included updates from the community, presentations on recent projects, and discussions on future plans. The call was well-received, and we had a great turnout of participants from various backgrounds. We plan to continue these community calls on a regular basis, and we encourage all members to join in and contribute to the discussions.

### Conference

In addition to community calls, we are also exploring other ways to keep the momentum going and engage with our community. This includes planning for future conferences, workshops, and events that will bring together experts and enthusiasts in the field of scientific computing. We are also looking into collaborations with other organisations and communities across languages and dialects to expand our reach and impact.

Provided enough interest and support, we aim to host the next edition of the SciPy India conference, in person, in either late 2025 or early 2026. The conference, as always, will feature a mix of keynote speakers, technical sessions, and networking opportunities for attendees. We are currently in the planning stages and will be sharing more details in the coming months as we finalise the venue, dates, and call for proposals, and we could definitely use your help in making this happen!

Stay tuned for more updates on our upcoming initiatives and events, and keep spreading the word about SciPy India!
